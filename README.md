# Synthetic data and re-identification risks

This is the code used thoughout the thesis, Synthetic data and re-identification risks. All experimentation as well as the final code is preset here.

## Instructions

To be able to run all scrits there is the need to change the absolute paths of the files pointint to whatever files it is intended to use. As well as being careful where the output of it is.

## Warnings

It is a fragile code as it was intended for personal use and with not the intention of being used in further aplications. For any help or further explanation of the code please contact me at up201503723@fc.up.pt.
